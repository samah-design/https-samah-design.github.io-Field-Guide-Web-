		<h2>The Butterfly Symbolism And Spiritual Meanings</h2>
		<p>Butterflies are often seen as symbols of change, transformation and rebirth. Some say they are omens of good luck and bring messages of light hailing new beginnings.The more specific meaning behind seeing these beautiful insects may be interpreted in different ways depending on circumstances and various cultural or spiritual perspectives, but it’s important to pay attention when a butterfly visits you.It is believed that seeing butterflies may be a call from the Universe that you are in the midst of or about to enter the kind of incredible journey a caterpillar goes through in order to shed its Earth-bound skin and grow wings. A caterpillar (or larva) grows larger, molts, hangs upside down and spins its silk cocoon (if it is going to become a moth) or chrysalis (if it is going to become a butterfly), where it essentially digests itself and dissolves, being reborn into a beautiful flying creature like no other.Butterflies teach us the importance of change and that, in order to become something great, you must be patient and have faith.Because they experience a form of resurrection, in many cultures butterflies represent the soul undergoing spiritual transformation.While there are a wide variety of butterfly species across the globe with varying colors, the most memorable trait of any butterfly is arguably its remarkable wings.

			<h2>The Spiritual Meaning of Seeing Butterflies</h2>
		<p>
If you’re seeing butterflies, it’s a sign of positive change. You may want to ask yourself what changes you need to make to live more in alignment with your true, authentic self. Or, if you’re already experiencing change and transformation in your life, a butterfly may be appearing to remind you it’s all going to be OK. Butterflies are also thought to represent a spiritual journey. An important aspect of life is learning how to let things go and develop into your higher self, no matter what’s happening around you, as this is a key factor in your personal growth.A butterfly grows out of a caterpillar, but it’s also an entirely new being. It flies instead of crawling. Its light and fluttery, no longer the dense compact worm it used to be. Even its diet is different – caterpillars nibble leaves while butterflies prefer (salt and) nectar from flowers.When that squirming bug becomes a beautiful butterfly, it starts a new life. So a butterfly landing on your means something fresh is coming. This might be a job offer, an unexpected relationship, a project launch, or the chance to buy a car or house. It’s all about beginnings.Dreaming of a butterfly is a sign of change.</p>
